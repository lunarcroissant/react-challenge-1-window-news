#How to setup this project locally on your computer

##Prerequisites

You can use either npm or yarn to built this project, so please choose one of the two following approaches in case you haven't installed either on them on your system.

* npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, 
you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

or

* Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installation

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project and run (Please note that you may need to delete the existing 'node_modules' in the project folder):

```
git clone https://github.com/lunarcroissant/challenge-1-react.git

npm
```
npm install

```
or

yarn
```
yarn install

```


Make sure all the dependencies are installed before running it with:
 
npm
```
npm start

```
or

yarn
```
yarn start

```

Your browser should now automatically open a new window/tab where you can see the react project. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
